# Pokedex

## Considerations

Where requirements are ambiguous, I use the following assumptions:

- To see the search history, focus the search text input.
- Only successful searches should be saved to history
- Search requires a specific Pokemon and returns one result that exacly matches that pokemon, as opposed to a list of pokemon whose names partially match the search term. This is because I didn't see a partial word search in the API provided.
